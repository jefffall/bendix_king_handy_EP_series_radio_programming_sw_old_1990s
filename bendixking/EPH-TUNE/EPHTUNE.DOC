Setting the COM port for EPHTUNE |
----------------------------------
The default COM port for EPHTUNE is COM 1.  The COM port can be changed 
to COM 2 in either of two ways.  The COM port can be specified on the command line, 
e.g.,
	
EPHTUNE 2 <CR>

or, the GFLG environment variable can set to indicate the COM 
port.   
	SET GFLG=-c2

Note that the 'c' in -c2 must be lower case and only ports 1 and 2 are 
valid.

Using EPHTUNE |
---------------
EPHTUNE allows the adjustment of 3 of the EPH Series radios operating 
parameters: receiver tuning slope, transmitter high power set, and 
transmitter low power set.

*General*
Connect the radio to an IBM PC or compatible computer using the EPH
series programming/test cable.  This cable allows access to the antenna 
and audio connectors while programming the radio.

*Key functions*
PgUp/PgDn	Increases or decreases the value of the highlighted 
		setting displayed on the screen.  DOES NOT alter this
		value in the radio.

keypad +/-	Increases or decreases the value of the highlighted
		setting and updates the highlighted value in the radio.

ENTER		Updates the radio with all values displayed on the screen.

F2		Updates all screen values with those obtained from the 
		radio.

numeric keys	Directly enters a value in the highlighted field.

ESC		Exits the EPHTUNE program.

*Reciever front end slope*
To adjust the receiver front end slope, set up the test equipment to 
measure sensitivity.  Program the radio and RF source to a frequency 
near the high end of the band.  Adjust the coils in the receiver for 
maximum sensitivity.  Program the radio and RF source for a frequency near 
the low end of the band.  Invoke EPHTUNE.  If the radio EEPROM is new or 
has been erased, enter an initial receiver slope setting of 26 and press 
<ENTER>.  Using the '+' and '-' keys on the keypad, adjust the receiver 
slope for maximum sensitivity.  This setting can be any number between 0 
and 255.

NOTE:  Because of RF interference from the computer, the radio may not 
meet the sensitivity specification until disconnected and removed from the 
immediate vicinity of the computer.


Transmitter power settings
Set up up the test equipment to measure transmitter power.  Program the 
radio for the desired transmit frequency, and set the HI/LO power switch 
as desired.  On the computer, use the cursor keys to move the cursor to 
the HI or LO power setting.  Key the radio and measure the transmitter 
power.  Unkey the radio.  Adjust the appropriate power setting and repeat 
as necessary.  The transmitter power settings can be any number between 
0 and 63.

NOTE:  	The radio does not commumicate with the computer while 
	transmitting!  Unkey the radio before changing any radio
	settings.  An attempt to modify these values while trasmitting
	will NOT damage the radio, but will cause an error to be displayed
	at the bottom of the screen.  To clear this error, unkey the radio
	and press the F2 key to re-read the radio settings.
