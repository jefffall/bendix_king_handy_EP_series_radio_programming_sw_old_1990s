When UHFEDIT is executed              from DOS the file CONFIG.URE is sought.  CONFIG.URE contains the                name of the system configuration file which is then linked with the             program.  If the system configuration file specifies a default data             file that data file is loaded otherwise all data variables are cleared.                                                                                                                                                                         The UHF EDITOR consists of:                                                	 A complete screen editor comprising of 15 active data banks and a             	       working data bank.  The working data bank (editor bank 0) may           	       be used to temporarily store and edit data.  NOTE the working           	       bank can not be saved either to a radio or to disk.                     	  Radio communication drivers to upload and download data to a radio.          	  An Active and Working set of global parameters.  NOTE the working            	       set of global parameters can not be saved to radio or disk.             	  Complete disk operations allowing magnetic data storage.                     	  Macro commands easing laborious editing tasks.                               	  A printer driver.                                                            	  Provisions for changing the EDITOR operating environment                                                                                                          A note about banks.  Radio Banks (or Groups), Editor Banks, and Disk            Banks may or may not have a one for one correspondence.  For example            Radio Bank 1 could be uploaded to Editor Bank 2 which in turn could             be saved to Disk Bank 3.  Correspondence between the radio, the editor          and disk storage is determined from the configurations in the SYSTEM            menu.  MACRO commands can be used to further manipulate Editor Bank data.                                                                                                                                                                  
