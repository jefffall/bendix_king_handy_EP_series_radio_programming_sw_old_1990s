				DTMF_DEV 2.0

The DTMF_DEV program is provided to facillate altering the DTMF deviation
level.  This level is controlled by software and can be adjusted without
disassembling the radio.

The program is designed for use on IBM or IBM-compatible computers with a
disk drive operating under DOS version 3.30 or compatible DOS.  The
computer must also be equipped with an RS-232 interface and an LAA 0705
interface (available from Bendix/King).



Setting DTMF deviation

1.	Configure the radio to send DTMF tones:

	-- Use the UHF EDITOR to enable the DTMF tones.
	
					-or-
	
	-- Place the unit in programming mode and enable Function 5, Group 2
	   of Ch 0.  (See the UHF/VHF programming manual)
 
2.	Connect the radio to a modulation meter as described in SECTION V of
	the LPU series maintenance manual.

3.	Connect the radio to the computer using the LAA 0705 interface.

4.	Type:  DTMF_DEV

5.	Use the UP/DOWN arrow keys and select the COM port your LAA0705 is
	connected to.

6.	Every 4 seconds (or so) the computer will attempt to make connections
	with the radio.  Either "Attempting Connection" or "Connection
	Failed" will be displayed near the middle of the screen.

	NOTE:  If you need to quit the program press the ESC key at any time.

7.	The "DTMF Deviation Level Bar" will indicate your current relative FM
	deviation for transmitted DTMF tones.  You may increase or decrease
	deviation using the right or left arrow keys.

8.	Press ENTER to download the new DTMF deviation to the radio. 
	"DOWNLOADING" will momentarily flash in the middle of the screen.

9.	Whenever "READY TO TEST" is highlighted in the middle of the screen
	you may test the FM deviation of your radio.  Key the radio and press
	a key while monitoring your deviation meter.

10.	Repeat steps 7 through 9 until your deviation is correct.
