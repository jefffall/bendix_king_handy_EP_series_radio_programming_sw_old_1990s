				PASSWORD

The PASSWORD program is provided to allow the password of LPU-series 
radios to be accessed and modified.

This program is designed for use on IBM or IBM-compatible computers with a
disk drive operating under DOS version 3.30 or compatible DOS.  The 
computer must also be equipped with an RS-232 interface and an LAA 0705 
interface (available from Bendix/King).



1.0	Connecting the LPU-series radio to the computer

	Connect the radio to the computer using the LAA 0705 interface.
	Use the appropriate commands to set the default disk and directory to
	where PASSWORD.EXE resides.  Type: PASSWORD

 	If the RS-232 port on your computer is not configured as COM1 use the
	arrow keys to move the cursor to the Change COM PORT option and press
	<ENTER>.  Use the space bar to toggle the displayed COM port and press
	<ENTER> to select it.


1.1	Read/Set Password

	To view the password currently programmed into the radio, use the arrow
	keys to move the cursor to the 'Read/Set Password' menu option.  This
	menu option allows this password to be modified and retained to allow
	easy programming into multiple radios.

	The current password will be displayed in the edit field.  The password
	status  (ENABLED/DISABLED) will also be displayed.  The following keys 
	can be used to modify the password:

		Left, Right arrow keys	Moves cursor one character

		<Backspace>		Moves the cursor to the first character

		<Up arrow>		Clears password to all zeroes

		<ENTER>			Stores password for later use

		<ESC>			Exits to main menu, password not stored

		<SPACE BAR>		Increments keyboard enterable passwords
					by one.  See section 1.5

	If the password loaded was shown to be DISABLED, it will automatically
	be ENABLED when programmed into a radio.

1.2	Program Password

	When this option is selected from the main menu, the password from the
	Read/Set Password operation (if one was entered) is displayed in the
	edit field.  Pressing <ENTER> will program the displayed password into 
	the radio and enable the PASSWORD feature.

	The password can be modified as before with the following exception: 
	The <Up arrow> key will swap the current password programmed into the
	radio into the edit field, regardless of what may have been entered 
	under the Read/Set option.  The <ESC> key will exit this function 
	without programming the password into the radio.

1.3	Disable Password

	Pressing <ENTER> when this menu option is highlighted will disable
	the password in the radio.  The password is still retained in the
	radio's memory, but the radio will not prompt for the password when put
	in programming mode.

1.4	Examples

	To enable the password already stored in the radio:

		Select 'Program Password'
		Press 'S'   (puts current radio password into the edit field)
		Press <ENTER>

	To program multiple radios with the same password:

		1  Select 'Read/Set password'
		2  Change the password in the edit field as necessary
		3  Press <ENTER>  (Stores the password for next step)
		4  Select 'Program Password'
		5  Press <ENTER>  (programs radio with password)

		--To program additional radios with this password--
		6  Press <ENTER>  ('Program Password' is already highlighted
		   at the main menu)
		7  Press <ENTER>  (programs radio with password)
	
	Repeat steps 6 and 7 (press <ENTER> twice) to program each additional
	radio.

1.5	Disabling Keyboard Programming

	To disable radio programming from the keyboard.  Enter any of the
	following characters into the password: 

			C, D, E, F

	Whenever one of these characters is present in the password in the
	edit field, a warning will be displayed.  Note that a password 
	containing one of these characters cannot be incremented.
